# Metrics

Measuring effectiveness (productivity) metrics is exceptionally challenging
as it is challenging to define "productivity." For simplicity sake, letâ€™s
define "productivity" as a relationship between the input and the output. The
input is a blend of factors (technical, individual, human, etc.) The output
should be functional software that creates value for customers. It stands to
reason that if you remove the blockers from the input, productivity will
increase naturally.

Several metrics allow you to quickly and accurately diagnose where work gets
stuck, who needs help, and where the greatest opportunities lie for
continuous improvement.
